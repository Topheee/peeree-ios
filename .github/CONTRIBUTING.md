# How to Contribute

This project is my little exercise on Swift programming. While it is not really popular today, I still want to make it possible to contribute.

To make it as easy as possible for you to contribute and for me to keep an overview, here are a few guidelines which should help us avoid all kinds of unnecessary work or disappointment. And of course, this document is subject to discussion, so please [create an issue](https://github.com/PeereeApp/peeree-ios/issues/new/choose) or a pull request if you find a way to improve it!

> __Private Reports__: Usually, all issues are tracked publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/PeereeApp/peeree-ios/issues). If you want to make a private report (e.g., for a vulnerability or to attach an example that is not meant to be published), please send an email to <support@peeree.de>.

# Process

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/PeereeApp/peeree-ios/issues/new/choose) - assuming one does not already exist - and describe your concern. Note you need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) for this.
2. Describe your issue. Please stick to the provided issue template ([bug report](https://github.com/PeereeApp/peeree-ios/blob/develop/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.yml) if possible. For questions, feature or support requests, please [open a discussion](https://github.com/PeereeApp/peeree-ios/discussions/new).
    - If it is a bug, please describe how to **reproduce** it. If possible, attach a complete example which demonstrates the error. Please also state what you **expected** to happen instead of the error.
    - If you propose a change or addition, try to give an **example** how the improved code could look like or how to use it.
    - If you found a compilation error, please tell us which Xcode version you used and paste the (relevant part of) the error messages to the ticket.


# Please Don't

While we value your time spent on the project, please try to avoid:
- Addition of new dependencies. We try to keep the app's size small.
- Any code changes (features, bug fixes, refactoring) that break compatibility with the current minimum iOS version.
- Add Objective-C code. This project should remain Swift-only.
- Space-indented code.
- Opening pull requests that address multiple issues.

# Please Do

The following areas really need contribution:
