## Building the App

For the *Peeree* target in the Xcode project's settings, change the developer profile to your own profile and change the `Bundle Identifier` as well.
Simply open `Peeree.xcodeproj` using Xcode and hit `build`.

## Debugging
Create an `LLDBInitFile` at the root of this project and add the path to the cloned `matrix-ios-sdk` repository to the source map:
```
settings set target.source-map /Users/runner/work/MatrixSDK/MatrixSDK/matrix-ios-sdk/MatrixSDK /path/to/matrix-ios-sdk/MatrixSDK
```
